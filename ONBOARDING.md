# Baquex – Developer Onboarding Guide

## Project Purpose and Overview

Baquex is a declarative framework designed to simplify the creation of
back-office admin panels and dashboards. Instead of hand-coding UI pages and
logic, developers use Baquex to describe what the interface and behavior should
be, and the framework handles the underlying implementation. In essence, Baquex
provides a high-level, declarative API for building stylish admin dashboards –
aiming to turn complexity (forms, data tables, etc.) into streamlined
functionality with minimal effort. The framework abstracts common web app
concerns (UI components, state management, event handling, etc.) so that
developers can focus on configuration and layout of their back-office panels
rather than low-level code.
